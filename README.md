Just a collection of different wallpapers that I found from many different sources.

All credits go to their respective artists. Note that some of the art may or may not be AI generated.

If you want to submit some wallpapers, feel free to make a pull request. Just make sure they're actually free to use since some people do sell these things and I don't want to infringe on intellectual property rights and stuff
